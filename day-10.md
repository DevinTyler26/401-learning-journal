## my pitch 
Hi I am Devin Cunningham and I am a software developer...

Previously I was a Marketing and Communications Specialist focusing on design and advertising for a healthcare company. 

Learning how to code has always been a want for me ever since the days of myspace when you could edit the html on your page. I thought it was the coolest thing that you could make edits online and others would be able to see it live.

I like javaScript because it is very flexible and can be used for the front end and back end and I like to learn skills that can be applied to many different areas throughout my life.

I want to be in an environment that is flexible and respects the work life balance while still being able to provide for my future family.

While working for Allegro Pediatrics, I saw many workflows that could have been improved by simple apps. And I think being able to see those needs are very important to being a developer.
