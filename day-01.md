Day 1 Jest and testing
Remember to run test it is npm run test
To run just one test it is npm run test filename
Make sure you run a test that you know will fail, then run a test that should pass to make sure your test are running correctly
Dont forget to add jest as a dependency

Once I remembered everything above, it was easy to make and run test for the lab! Today went very well.
