##big o
Runtime = Time complexity
O(n) is usually for loops or while loops or maps or filters or linear regression
O(1) any constants - any if statements - insertion - these dont depend on the size of an input
O(n^2) nested for loops 

Space complexity
map and filter add extra space because they return new arrays
