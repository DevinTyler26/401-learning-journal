## binary search trees
- less than or equal to root <= left of root
- more that root > right of root
- time and space O(log n)
- b^c = a is equal to logb a = c
- log n base is 2
- 2^0 = log2 1 = 0
- lg = log2

## k-ary tree
```
      1
     /|\
    2 3 4
     /|\
    5 6 7
      |
      8
 ```
- time: O(n)
- space: O(w) -> w is the width of the tree
